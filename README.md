# Example Ionic2, CouchDB and PouchDB

Sample project that shows a fullstack application where we will be building a blogging application in Ionic 2 that uses
CouchDB as its database and backend.

 * Frontend: Ionic2.
 * Backend: CouchDB
 
 This project is an example created in the [Josh Morony Blog](https://www.joshmorony.com/couchdb-pouchdb-and-ionic-2-starting-a-new-project/) that have been modified by me.
 This project has been developed to practice my skills with the tech stack shown above. This project shows you how to:
 
 * Adding Posts and Live Data Updates (add and view posts).
 * Adding Comments.
 * Adding images post (upload to CouchDB).

## Configuration

1. Download and install [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/).
	
2. Install dependencies and run Ionic App

	Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of Ionic 2 concepts. You must also already have Ionic 2 installed on your machine.

	* Run npm install
	* Test in localhost: ionic serve
	* Test in Android mobile: Add Android Platform: ionic add platform android / Add iOS Platform: ionic add platform ios
	* Run: ionic run android / ionic run ios
	
	
NOTE: Test in mobile: Change localhost IP in couchdb local.ini file. MAC (/Users/your-user/Library/Application Support/CouchDB/etc/couchdb/local.ini)
